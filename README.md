![Architecture](aws/AWS_architecture.png?raw=true "Architecture")

# Requirements

   - an AWS account
   - an internet domain (a third level is better) on Route53 or anywhere itâ€™s possible to configure the DNS zone
   - a pair of Google reCAPTCHA keys (site / private) valid for your domain ([reCAPTCHA console](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin))

# Installation (backend)

To build the entire backend infrastructure you can use the CloudFormation console or AWS CLI:

`aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name <name> --template-url <url> --parameters <parameters> --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM`

Description:

      <name>
            the stack name 
            
      <url> 
            template URL https://cfvn.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/disposable.yml
            
      <parameters>
            ParameterKey=DomainName,ParameterValue=<your_domain>  
            ParameterKey=ReCaptchaPrivateKey,ParameterValue=<your_private_captcha_key>

Once the stack is created, you need to know the newly created endpoint to be used in web application configuration. 
This is provided by CloudFormation as an output value. It is possible to get it in the CloudFormation console or directly from AWS CLI:

`aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name <name> --query Stacks[0].Outputs[0].OutputValue`


# Installation (frontend)

To create the React web application, once the repository has been cloned, it is necessary to configure some parameters at the beginning of App.js file:

      //  - your APIEndpoint
      const APIEndpoint = <your_API_endpoint>; 

      //  - your ReCaptcha Site Key
      const ReCaptcha_SiteKey = <your_reCAPTCHA_site_key>;  
 
      //  - your email domain 
      const email_domain = <your_domain>;

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
